Users and Interests
  - (1) Home page
    + Lists all the users name
    + YAML document
  - (2) Each name is a link to a page for the user
  - (3) E-mail address, interests dispayed on user's page
    + Comma between each interest
  - (4) Links to other user pages
    + Bottom of page
    + Current user page not in links
  - (5) Layout
    + "There are !X* users with a total of !X* interests."
  - (6) Update message to include number of users and interests
        based on YAML file.
    + `count_interests` helper method
    + Total number of interests across all users
  - (7) Add a user to `users.yaml`
    + Verify the site loads correctly

Approach
  - (1)
    + Main application file
      = `before` method for loading the `public` YAML file
      = `get`, `@users` from keys on the top layer of info hash
    + `home.erb`
      = Head
        > Title - Mini Social
      = Body
      = `<div>`
      = `<h2>` - MINI SOCIAL
      = List the users
      = Iterate `@users`
  - (2)
    + `home.erb`
      = Add a `<a>` with the `href` for a page by that name
        > Input the user's name from the
    + `user_pg.erb`
      = Page by that name?
        > I have a list of the users in `@users`
        > Have `params` hash
        > Use a `:name` key
        > Can create a title for any name in the hash with a
          parameter
        > Can throw an error if the name is not found
        > `@user_name` for title in `head`

    + `get` for user pages
      = Add a `:name` parameter to the route
  - (3)
    + Main application file
    + `user_pg.erb`
      = `@interests`
      = `@email`
      = Output the e-mail
      = List the interests with a comma
  - (4)
    + `user_pg.erb`
      = Footer
      = List
      = Links to other user pages
      = Iterate `@users`
        > Interpolate the name into `href` link
        > Output name in `<li>` item
  - (5) & (6)
    + Main application file
      = Count the users
      = `count_interests` helper method
      = Iterate the users
        > Access the hash with the `@users`
        > Retrieve the interests arrays
        > Count the values of each interests array
  - (7)
    + Add a user to the `users.yaml` file
